We have optimized Combined Actuarial Neural Networks, CANN, with Design of Experiments technique, Response Surface Methodology (RSM). 
Our computational experiments are divided in 3 steps:
  1. initial screening of the hyperparameter space
  2. sequential search strategy for the minimum
  3. the final second order experiments. The python codes we have used are included and labelled accordingly.
